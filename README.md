This sets out methods and data sources for data on profits received by members of "partnership" plasma schemes investigated by The Gecko Project in 2022.  For more details, see https://thegeckoproject.org/articles/promised-prosperity-drowning-in-debt/

# Methods
Data was obtained through interviews and analysis of documentary evidence collected by reporters commissioned by The Gecko Project, Mongabay and BBC News in October 2022. In many cases data on profits received by plasma cooperative members was difficult to obtain, because communities did not have access to it and companies did not respond to requests to share it. We were able to obtain sufficient data from members of ten cooperatives that had entered partnerships with plantation companies to draw conclusions about the profits they were receiving in 2022. 

In instances where members of the same cooperative reported receiving differing levels of profit, we calculated an average of the profit figures in that cooperative. We then calculated the average profits received, per hectare per month, across the ten cooperatives and converted them into USD at average exchange rates for 2022. 

# Poverty line and minimum wages

## International poverty line
The international poverty line is defined by the World Bank as $2.15 per person per day, or $784.75 per year. See: Global Poverty Lines (2022) World Bank. Available at: https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/factsheet/2022/05/02/fact-sheet-an-adjustment-to-global-poverty-lines. 

## National poverty line
The national poverty line set by the government in March 2022 is 505,469 rupiah (equivalent to $34) per person per month. See  Statistics Indonesia (2022) Persentase Penduduk Miskin Maret 2022 turun menjadi 9,54 persen, Badan Pusat Statistik. Available at: https://www.bps.go.id/pressrelease/2022/07/15/1930/persentase-penduduk-miskin-maret-2022-turun-menjadi-9-54-persen.html

## Provincial minimum wage (UMP)
The average of the provincial minimum wage (UMP) in the provinces in which the cases we investigated were located was 2,638,852 rupiah (equivalent to $180) per month. This was equivalent to $2,159.64 per year at average USD-IDR exchange rates for 2022. For minimum wages, see: Satu Data (2022) Upah Minimum Provinsi (UMP) Tahun 2022. Available at: https://satudata.kemnaker.go.id/infografik/49. 

# Findings

- In the ten named cases, a villager with a two-hectare area of plasma would receive, on average, $338 dollars per year – less than one dollar a day. 
- With two hectares of plasma, a cooperative member in the partnerships we investigated would receive, on average, 413,076 rupiah (equivalent to $28) per month. 

# Notes
We also collected data on profits received by cooperative members in years before 2022 from three-quarters of our sources; in these cases, the profit figures we obtained were the same as (or lower than) those we collected in 2022.

Two of the 12 companies we investigated are not named here because we were unable to obtain reliable data on cooperative members’ profits or debts.
